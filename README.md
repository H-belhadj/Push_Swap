# Push Swap - Sorting Algorithm with RANGE

![Push Swap](push_swap.png)

## Introduction

Welcome to the Push Swap repository! This project focuses on developing a sorting algorithm, utilizing the RANGE approach, to efficiently sort a stack of numbers.

## About the Project

The push_swap project, a part of the curriculum at 42, challenges you to sort a stack of numbers using a limited set of operations. In this implementation, we have designed a sorting algorithm that leverages the RANGE approach to minimize the number of operations required for sorting.

## Installation

To get started with the push_swap algorithm, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone [repository_url]
   cd push_swap
   ```

2. Compile the project:

   ```shell
   make
   ```

## Usage

To run the push_swap algorithm on a set of numbers, use the following command:

```shell
./push_swap [numbers]
```

Replace `[numbers]` with the numbers you want to sort. The push_swap algorithm will output a series of instructions representing the required operations to sort the given numbers.

## Testing

To test the correctness and efficiency of the push_swap algorithm, you can use a separate tester developed by the community. Here are the steps to install and use the tester:

1. Clone the tester repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/LeoFu9487/push_swap_tester.git
   cd push_swap_tester
   ```

2. Follow the instructions provided in the tester repository's README to set up and compile the tester.

3. Run the push_swap algorithm on a set of numbers:

   ```shell
   ./push_swap [numbers]
   ```

4. Pipe the output of the push_swap program into the tester to verify the correctness and efficiency:

   ```shell
   ./push_swap [numbers] | ./checker [numbers]
   ```

   The checker program will validate whether the push_swap output performs the correct operations to sort the given numbers.

If you encounter any issues with the tester or have questions about its usage, please refer to the documentation and README provided in the tester repository.
